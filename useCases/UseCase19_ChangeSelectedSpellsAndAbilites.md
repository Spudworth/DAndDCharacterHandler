#Use Case 19 â€“ Change Selected Spells and Abilities


**Description:** 
The player will be able to have 3 selected spells at any one time. They will be able to change these spells with other spells they may have learned to offer a new play experience each time.
Once a ability is learned it will always be active but the player can change the order in which these abilities are displayed with their character.
