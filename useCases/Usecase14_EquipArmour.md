#Use Case 14 - Equip Armour

**Description:** The player will be able to equip pieces of armour. They may only wear one piece of part of armour (e.g. Helmet, chest plate...) and may only equip a piece of armour that they own and have in their inventory and are able to wear.

**Alternate-route :** If the player earns or buys a new set of armour they will automatically be given the option of equiping the new set of armour.
