#Use case 3 â€“ Re-subscribe 

**Description:** If the user wishes to re-subscribe to obtain a premium membership, they will be permitted to either use previously used payment details or input new payment details. The user can still choose which contract type that they wish to re-subscribe to or if they wish for their account to automatically resubscribe at the end of the contract type chosen.

**Main success scenario:**
**1.** The player is prompted with a message stating that their premium membership is up.
**2.** The player initiates the  re-subscribe option in the message.
**3.** The System now displays the sign up for premium membership page.
**4.** The player selects to re-subscribe with same contract type.
**5.** The player is given the option to click terms and conditions.
**6.** The player is provided with a confirmation message declaring that they have successfully resubscribed. 

**Alternative Scenario 1:**
**1.** The player has previously initiated that the payment be automatically taken out of the account upon the termination of contract type. Therefore, a message will only be promoted to the user to remind them the they have been resubscribed.
