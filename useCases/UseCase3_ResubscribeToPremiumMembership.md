#Use case 3 â€“ Re-subscribe 

**Description:** If the user wishes to re-subscribe to obtain a premium membership, they will be permitted to either re-use previously used payment details or input new payment details. The user can still choose which contract type that they wish to re-subscribe to or if they wish for their account to automatically resubscribe at the end of the contract type chosen.
