#Use case 1 – Create an Account

**Description:** A user is required an account to login. Therefore, if the user doesn’t already have an account created, this option is chosen. Once chosen, the user will be required to enter details as such, name, username, password, email address and age. If any of these details aren’t valid, the user will be prompted to input correct details. Once successful, the user can login to their account.
